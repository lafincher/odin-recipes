        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Growing up, I never considered tuna salad as fish. That was weird! I love tuna salad so much I could eat it every day.</p>
        <p>I like to pair my tuna with crackers, slices of cheese, and sliced pickles to make a stack of yum but it's just as good between two slices of bread.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cans tuna, in water</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dill relish, or more, to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Duke's mayo</li>
            <li>2 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Spike Seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drain cans of tuna</li>
            <li>Add all ingredients to a bowl</li>
            <li>Stir to combine</li>
            <li>Taste and add anything you want more of</li>
            <li>Serve with crackers or on a sandwich</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Spike Seasoning is the secret ingredient in this one!</p>
